Q2: Difference Between Arrays and Linked Lists.

Explanation:

1. Memory Allocation:
   - Arrays require a fixed amount of memory allocated in advance.
   - Linked lists use pointers to connect nodes dynamically.

2. Performance:
   - Arrays offer O(1) time complexity for direct access via indices.
   - Linked lists need O(n) time complexity for traversal since you follow pointers.

3. Insertion & Deletion:
   - Arrays require shifting elements for insertion and deletion, making these operations slow (O(n)).
   - Linked lists allow fast insertion/deletion at the head or tail (O(1)).
